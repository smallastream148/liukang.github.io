## Background
I am a professional in the field of maritime education. Currently, I work at Zhejiang Institute of communications, and I have previously served as a seafarer on oil tankers. 
My primary research area focuses on factors influencing ship safety, particularly in the domains of maritime distress rescue and human-related safety factors. I have led and contributed to multiple national and provincial research projects and have published numerous academic papers in relevant fields.

In addition, I have a strong interest in swimming and running, and I actively participate in amateur marathon events.
